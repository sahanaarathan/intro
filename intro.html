    <p1><i><b><big> Hello people, my name is SAHANAA RATHAN . Im currently pursuing my studies at Chennai Institute of Technology, specialising in CSE . I have always been someone who is deeply curious , whether its learning something new , understanding how things work, or engaging with different perspectives. </b></i></p1> 
    <p2><i><b><br><br> Academically, Im particularly interested in Computer Science , but I had to take Biology instead of CS in my sen.sec. for some reasons. Anyways Im eager to explore how I can apply what I learn to the real World. </b></i></p2>
    <p3><i><b><br><br> One of my goals here is not just to do well academically, but also to grow as a person by connecting with people from different walks of life, taking part in meaningful projects and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. </b></i></p3>
    
    <p4><i><b><br><br> Im looking forward to contributing to this environment and learning as I can along the way... </big></b></i></p4>
